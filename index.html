  <!--
    There are 6 scripts on this page that are exactly the same.  The only difference is the `async` and `defer` attributes that some of them have as well as the position on the page they are listed.
    In order to see a noticeable difference in page load performance, use Chome Dev Tools to throttle your internet connection then uncomment one script at a time.  Notice the change in the event timeline.
    This exercise will help you learn the difference of each of these DOM events and understand the importance of proper JS script management.
